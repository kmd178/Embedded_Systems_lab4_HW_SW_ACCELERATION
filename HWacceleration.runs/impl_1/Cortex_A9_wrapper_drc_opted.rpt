REQP-1840#1 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 Cortex_A9_i/led_ip/inst/led_ip_v1_0_S_AXI_inst/kmd1/memInputY_reg has an input control pin Cortex_A9_i/led_ip/inst/led_ip_v1_0_S_AXI_inst/kmd1/memInputY_reg/ENARDEN (net: Cortex_A9_i/led_ip/inst/led_ip_v1_0_S_AXI_inst/kmd1/g0_b0_n_0) which is driven by a register (Cortex_A9_i/led_ip/inst/led_ip_v1_0_S_AXI_inst/kmd1/FSM_sequential_state_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1840#2 Warning
