WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (REQP-1840) RAMB18 async control check - The RAMB18E1 Cortex_A9_i/led_ip/inst/led_ip_v1_0_S_AXI_inst/kmd1/memInputY_reg has an input control pin Cortex_A9_i/led_ip/inst/led_ip_v1_0_S_AXI_inst/kmd1/memInputY_reg/ENARDEN (net: Cortex_A9_i/led_ip/inst/led_ip_v1_0_S_AXI_inst/kmd1//i___0_n_0) which is driven by a register (Cortex_A9_i/led_ip/inst/led_ip_v1_0_S_AXI_inst/kmd1/FSM_sequential_state_reg[0]) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
